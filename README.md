Navigation History for Sublime
==============================

This is a modified version of the original plugin by [Martin Aspeli](https://github.com/optilude).

Current Issues
--------------

1. When you navigate back/forward, it opens the cursor history in the current window. This is annoying if you use a multi-column or grid layout.
